# $RUGLORD - All Hail the Rug

This is the official meme coin website for **$RUGLORD**, the most honest dishonest token in crypto.  
We promised nothing. We delivered less. And that’s why they love us.

## What Is $RUGLORD?

$RUGLORD is a satirical meme coin that openly embraces the rug-pull culture, but ironically never rugs.

You buy it because it *knows* it’s not.
